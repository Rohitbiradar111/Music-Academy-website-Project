  {
    category: "Recording Techniques",
    details: `
        (1) Mic placement affects tone (close for detail, far for room ambiance)
        (2) Use pop filters for vocals to reduce plosive sounds
        (3) Double tracking guitars or vocals for a fuller sound
      `
  },
  {
    category: "Mixing Basics",
    details: `
        (1) Balance volume levels to ensure clarity
        (2) Use EQ to remove muddiness and enhance key frequencies
        (3) Panning instruments creates space and depth in the mix
      `
  },
  {
    category: "EQ & Frequency Balancing",
    details: `
        (1) Cut low frequencies from non-bass elements to reduce muddiness
        (2) Boost presence frequencies (2kHzâ€“5kHz) for clarity in vocals
        (3) Use subtractive EQ to remove unwanted resonances rather than boosting too much
      `
  },
  {
    category: "Compression & Dynamics",
    details: `
        (1) Use compression to even out volume inconsistencies
        (2) Attack & release settings affect how natural the compression feels
        (3) Sidechain compression helps make room for kick drums in a dense mix
      `
  },
  {
    category: "Reverb & Delay",
    details: `
        (1) Reverb adds depth; short for tight rooms, long for ambient effects
        (2) Delay can create space, movement, and rhythmic effects
        (3) Use pre-delay on reverb to avoid washing out the original sound
      `
  },
  {
    category: "Synthesis & Sound Design",
    details: `
        (1) Use oscillators, filters, and envelopes to shape synth sounds
        (2) Layer multiple synths with different textures for a rich sound
        (3) FM synthesis and wavetable synthesis create complex tones
      `
  },
  {
    category: "Beat Making & Groove",
    details: `
        (1) Vary velocity and timing for human-like drum patterns
        (2) Swing settings can make rigid beats feel more natural
        (3) Layer multiple drum samples for a thicker sound
      `
  },
  {
    category: "Arrangement & Structure",
    details: `
        (1) Build energy by introducing and removing elements
        (2) Use automation to create dynamic movement
        (3) Transitions (sweeps, risers) help connect different sections smoothly
      `
  },
  {
    category: "Mastering Techniques",
    details: `
        (1) Apply final EQ, compression, and limiting for a polished sound
        (2) Match loudness levels to streaming platform standards
        (3) Stereo widening and harmonic exciters add depth without over-processing
      `
  },
  {
    category: "Production Workflow & Creativity",
    details: `
        (1) Start with a rough idea and refine through iterations
        (2) Use reference tracks to guide mixing and arrangement decisions
        (3) Stay organized with proper labeling and track grouping
